# If-Then Statement

`if` and `then` are conditional logic that will be used in specific statements in java to allow us to check a condition if the condition is `true` or `false`.

In the example:

```java
boolean oldEnough = false;

        if (!oldEnough){
            System.out.println("No you cannot drink");
        }
```

`!oldEnough` is equal to `oldEnough == false`
